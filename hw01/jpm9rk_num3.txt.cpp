// On my honor as a student I have neither given nor received help on 
// this assignment
// Problem: write an algorithim to find the distance traveled in free 
//fall under the influence of gravity near the Earth's surface using the 
//formula s=s_0+v_0t+(1/2)at^2.
// Data Required: an initial position s_0 that is a positive number and 
// an initial velocity that can be a  positive or  negative number.
// Method: an input of an intial velocity and initial position is 
//required, and using -32ft/s^2 as the constant for acceleration, the 
//distance traveled in free fall near the earth's surface is calculated 
//at 5 second intervals from 0 to 100.
// Algorithim Pseudocode
// Input value for v_0, and s_0 and a constant of -32ft/s^2 for a
// t=0
// n=0
// d_total=s_0-s_20
// while t is  greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 100, 
// and s_0>0
// 	calculate position
//	s_n= s_0+v_0t+(1/2)at^2
//      	for n>0 
//			d_change= s_n-s_n-1
//			outprint d_change
//		end for
//
//	n=++
//      t=t+5
// outprint d_toal
