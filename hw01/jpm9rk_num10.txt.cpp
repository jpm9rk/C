// Problem: Write an algorithim to compute the kinetic energy of 
different sized disks off mass m=10 to mass m=100 in increments of 10 
and r= 10 to 50cm in increments of 10. The disks rotate at a speed 500 
rpm. KE=i(omega)^2/2 where i is the inertia of a uniform disk given by 
i=mr^2/2 where r is the radius of the disk in m and m is the mass  of 
the disk in kg. angular velocity is calculated according to 
(500rev/60s)(2pi/1rev)
// Data required: mass in increments of 10 from 10 to 100 and radius in 
increments of 10 from 10 to 50
// Method: input the mass and radius and calculate inertia using mr^2/2. 
//Then using the angular velocity computation, find the kinetic energy 
//according to k=iomega^2/2
// Algorithim
// m=10
// r=10
// omega=(500rev/60s)(2pi/1rev)
// while m is less than or equal to 100 and r is less than or equal to 
// 50 
//	i=mr^2/2
//	k=iomega^2/2
//	outprint kinetic energy
//      r= r+10
//	m= m+10
