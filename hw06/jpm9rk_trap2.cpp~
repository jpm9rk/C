//The trapezoid rule will work best for best for surfaces, and if
//there are changes in how much the surface curves up or down, that they 
//occur instantaneously
// The trapezoid rule works by 
//approximating with the area of trapezoids with straight lines, so functions
//that produce surfaces that are closest to the "ribbons" shown on the 
//homework will best be estimated by the trapezoid rule.
//If the function produces a surface that is concave down, it will
//under estimate the area under the curve, because the trapezoids will never 
//include the full colume
// under the surface, unless there are an infinite amount,
//and they will not extend above the surface
//A function that produces a concave down surface will over estimate
//the value of the volume under the surface because the trapezoids will
//extend out over the surface.
