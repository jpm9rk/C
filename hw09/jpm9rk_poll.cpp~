  //Yes it is a reliable pole, over large amounts of trials the histograms experience a
  //sharp peak around the expected values. Also, for a random sampling of 1600, the
  //margin of error is around 2.5%, and for a random sample size of 400 the
  //margin of error is 5%. For these numbers it is reasonable to assume that a 
  //random sampling of 1420 people will not have an overly large margin of error
